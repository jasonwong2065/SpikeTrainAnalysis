# SpikeTrainAnalysis
MATLAB data analysis of a Interspike Intervals of neurons in a monkey's brain and removing noise from spike train data.

Assignment 2- Spike Data Analysis.pdf is the exercise questions.
JasonWongAssignment2FINAL.pdf contains my analysis and answers.
JasonWongAssignment2.m contains the code I wrote to analyse Spike_data_1-4.mat

Glossary
Interspike Intervals is the amount of time between each neuron activation, this period of time decreases when an event occurs which triggers it.
A Spike Train is a signal from the brain, it is usually very noisy because of the amount of neurons,
  but by binning them and averaging them out, the noise can be reduced until clear visible spikes can be seen in the spike train
